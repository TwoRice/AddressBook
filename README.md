# AddressBook
I programmed my solution in a few hours over 2 days in PHP. I chose to use PHP as although its not the lanuage I have the most experience with for this type of task, I wanted to showcase that I do have some PHP knowledge as well as develop my knowledge through coding this task. I also chose PHP to give myself more of a refreshing challenge as most of the web applications I have made has been using JSP and I wanted to do something different. Because of this choice I do feel my solution did take me a little longer to implement as well as not being as good as I'd like it to be; I will include a compressed list of things I would have done better with more time at the end of this document.<br/><br/> 

<b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b><br/>
1. Deploy the code inside the webapp folder on a PHP server (I just used PHP 5.4's built in server) with sqlite3 extensions enabled.<br/>
2. The website is fairly self explanatory (I hope).<br/><br/>

<b>SOME THINGS I WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH MORE TIME:</b><br/>
1. Implemented MVC design pattern (I kind of have a very basic implementation of this, but it could be vastly improved)<br/>
2. Used functions instead of loads of tiny scripts (rather silly that I didn't do this)<br/>
3. Implemented REST<br/>
4. Used more robust resource referencing (I used ../ and some other bad practices in most cases, sqlConnection.php is an example where I didn't)<br/>
I could talk a lot more about what I did and didn't do well, but I'll keep it short for now.
